# JavaScript Snake üêç
I rebuilt snake, but with intentional limitation that everything is in JavaScript.

## Features
#### *Vanilla JavaScript*
Everything, including the styling and instantiataion of HTML elements, is done in JavaScript.
  
#### *High performing*
I put a lot of consideration into algorithm efficiency, as a result no method has a time complexity greater than O(n).

#### *A principled design*
I utilized OOP and SOLID principles to create a modular, reusuable design. 

Notably, the rendering logic is kept seperate from the game logic, it is a design that can easily be reimplemented in any language.
  
## Technologies Used
`JavaScript` `NextJS` `Vercel`

## How to Play
Use the arrow keys, on your keyboard, to control the snake's direction.

Collect the food items to increase the length of the snake.

Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body, as it's game over after that.

## Installation
To run this locally, follow these steps:

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd javascript-snake-game
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to play
