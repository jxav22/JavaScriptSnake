# JavaScript Snake üêç 
I rebuilt the classic arcade game with the intentional limitation that everything, including the styling and HTML elements, is instantiated in JavaScript.

I heavily proritized writing clean, efficient code and creating optimized algorithms. 

Notably, no method in this project has a time complexity greater than O(n)!

## Features
- *Pure Vinalla JavaScript*: The entire game, including styling and HTML elements, is built using JavaScript.
  
- *Efficient Code*: All functions are optimized, ensuring excellent performance without compromising on functionality.
  
- *Responsive Design*: The game is designed to work seamlessly on any screen size, providing a consistent gaming experience.

## Technologies Used
- *Next.js*: Built on top of Next.js, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.
  
- *Deploymen*t: The game is deployed on Vercel, providing fast and reliable hosting. Additionally, it can be deployed to Azure - there's a lot of flexibility in deployment options.

# How to Play

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's direction.
Collect the food items to increase the length of the snake.
Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body, as it's game over after that.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd javascript-snake-game
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to play the game!
